# Compact Calendar View

![](../images/calendar-compact-view.png)

Simple Calendar also allows users to view the module in a compact view. This view has a much more limited view but takes up less screen space for ease of keeping it always open.

The compact view will show:

- The current season.
- The current moon phase(s).
- The current date.
- The current time and real time clock status.
- Action buttons in the header to view any notes the current player can see or has reminders for on this date.

:::info
If you have [permissions](../global-configuration/permissions.md) to add notes to the calendar you will see an additional action button for adding a new note.

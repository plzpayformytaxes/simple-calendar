![](../../images/search.png)

Searching notes is easy in Simple Calendar, clicking the main search button, entering your search term in the text box then pressing enter or hitting the search button will show you the results! There are some details to take note of though.

## Searching

The search box is where you enter the text you are wanting to search for in notes.

:::caution Important
When performing a search, only notes that the current user can view are searched. They are not able to search against notes they can not view.

Clicking the search button, or hitting enter will then perform the search. The search is a fuzzy search, which means that slight misspellings (1 or 2 characters) will still be matched in the results.

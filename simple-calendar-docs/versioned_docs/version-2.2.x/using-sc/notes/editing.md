# Editing Notes

Users are allowed to edit any notes that they have added. Gamemasters are allowed to edit any note they can view.

If you are able to edit a note you will see some additional buttons when you are viewing the notes details.

Clicking the edit button will change the note details view into the note edit details view, where you can change all the details about a note.

To learn more about all the fields that can be changed on a note check out the [note field documentation](adding#note-fields).

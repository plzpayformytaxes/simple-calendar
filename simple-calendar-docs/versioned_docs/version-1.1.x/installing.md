# Installing The Module

There are 3 ways to install the module:

## Through Foundry

Foundry has a built-in directory of modules that you can install. The easiest way is to use this feature and search for "Simple Calendar" and install!

## module.json

Through the same built-in module installer in foundry, you can specify the link of the module to install instead of searching the directory. To install using the module json file, use this link [https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar/releases/latest/download/module.json](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar/releases/latest/download/module.json)

## Zip File

To install the most recent version of the module, view the releases section to the right of the main GitHub page.
Selecting the latest release will bring you to a page where you can download the module.zip asset. This will contain everything you need to manually install the module.

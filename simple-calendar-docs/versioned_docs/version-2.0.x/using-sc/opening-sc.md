# Opening Simple Calendar

Simple Calendar comes with several different ways to open and close the main calendar window.

## Toolbar

The main way to open up Simple Calendar is through the button under Journal Notes. By default, this button just opens the calendar window but if the user has enabled the [Persistent Open Client Setting](client-settings.md#persistent-open) then this button will toggle the calendar window open and closed.

## On Load

Each player can also [choose if Simple Calendar opens by default](client-settings.md#open-on-load) when FoundryVTT is loaded.

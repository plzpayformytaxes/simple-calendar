## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue / vulnerability please do not create an issue. Instead email me at [security@vig.vg](security@vig.vg) with the details.

Given that this is a module for another system I will do my best to address the issue or if I am unable to fix it pass the information off to the people who can.
